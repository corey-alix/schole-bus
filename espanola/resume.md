## Education

1993 | **BS Computer Science** | Carnegie Mellon

Lately I have been defining models that serialize to both JSON and XML for stronger integration with spatial systems. I have extensive knowledge of the WFS and WMS standards as well as ESRI's REST-based APIs.

I often work in Typescript extending web-based proxy controls that integrate with ol2, ol3, ags3 and ags4 using dojo, underscore-backbone-marionette, jquery.

## Experience

**Spatial Systems Integration**

Integrates with ESRI's AGS Server and OGC-compatible systems GeoServer and MapServer

## Database Experience

-   SpatialLite database for caching spatial data and performing spatial processing

-   Hosting DEV instances of PostGIS, MSSQL and SpatialLite for GeoServer integration testing and development

-   ArcSDE instances for ArcGIS Server integration testing and development

## Desktop and Server Experience

-   GIS-centric C# .NET CLI and Form tools, REST services, SOAP services for interfacing with external system

## Web Experience

-   Develop and Maintain 100k lines of Javascript (NPM-based build tools, OpenLayers, JSAPI, micro APIs)
